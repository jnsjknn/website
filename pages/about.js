            HiðŸ‘‹, I&apos;m Joonas, a Finnish engineer and programmer. I&apos;ve
            been practicing coding since the beginning of 2019. I specialize in
            programming building automation processes and web technologies such
            as React, Node.js, Next.js, MongoDB, and Express. Additionally, I
            have some experience with React Native, Electron, Python, C++, and
            Bash.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since 2021, my work has mainly focused on programming, testing, and
            ensuring the functionality of heat pump systems. I help people
            identify and fix the causes of issues in poorly functioning heating
            systems. I&apos;ve also been involved in the design of heat pump
            systems and programmed systems where most of the heat pump&apos;s
            operation is controlled through building automation systems. This
            includes functionalities like temperature deviation based variable
            delays in compressor control and start order determination with
            switch valve connected systems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy challenging programming projects where I have the
            opportunity to create new solutions rather than simply copying code
            from old projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feel free to reach out if you need help with heat pump issues or if
            you need someone to code a challenging process into a building
            automation system. I'm happy to help directly with quick queries,
            and if needed, I can pass on your request to the right person if it
            requires a larger investment of time and resources from my employer.
